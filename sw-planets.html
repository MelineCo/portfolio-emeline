                        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
                        <p>SW planets is a React project I completed in 1 week as part of my internship at Health for People. 
                            The aim was to familiarize myself with the company's technical stack before diving 
                            into the source code of TOMA Sant√© applications. 
                            Romain, my internship tutor, helped me when I encountered difficulties that kept me stuck for too long.</p>

                        <h3 id="skills">Required skills</h3>
                        <p>To complete this project, I needed the following skills:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Code with <span class="highlight">TypeScript</span></li>
                            <li>Fetch data with <span class="highlight">TanStack Query</span></li>
                            <li><span class="highlight">Use an API</span> to get Star Wars data</li>
                            <li>Use the library <span class="highlight">Material UI</span>.</li>
                            <li>Test the application with <span class="highlight">Vitest & React-testing-library</span></li>
                            <li>Deploy the application in production using <span class="highlight">Vercel</span></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 id="learn">What I learned</h2>

                        <h3 id="tanstack">Basics of TanStack query</h3>
                        <p>
                            The useQuery hook provided by <span class="highlight">TanStack Query facilitates the management of load, error and success states when retrieving asynchronous data</span> from a React application. 
                            It simplifies API calls, data state management and caching of query results.
                            Even with only the basics, I can see why this library is so popular.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="usercenteredtesting">User-centered testing</h3>
                        <p> 
                            User-centered testing ensures that the tests reflect real user interactions and behaviors.
                            React Testing Library provides several methods for testing React components by interacting with the DOM as a user would.
                            After this project, I better understand <span class="highlight">what to test: what the user sees and does</span>.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="outlet">useOutletContext</h3>
                        <p>I wanted to share a function between a component and its child component via an Outlet.
                             To do this, I usedOutletContext. The next challenge was to simulate the context in the tests.</p>
                          
                        <h2 id="difficulties">Difficulties</h2>

                        <h3 id="typescript">Getting used to TypeScript</h3>
                        <p>As I wasn't used to TypeScript, it was hard for me to read my code with TypeScript. 
                            <span class="highlight">I was slower at proofreading myself</span>, even though TS certainly saved me time by reducing potential errors.</p>
                        <p>And apart from the fact that proofreading wasn't as easy, I didn't know what and how to type or I often forgot to type my props... Oops! 
                            Which earned me some nice warnings.</p>

                        <h3 id="vitest">Tests configuration</h3>
                        <p>Initially, we wanted me to become more proficient with Jest and react-testing-library, 
                            as these are the testing tools used at Health for People.
                            But this quickly became a problem, as <span class="highlight">Vite and Jest can come into conflict when used together.</span> 
                            Finally, we decided to use Vitest, which is specifically designed to work with Vite.</p>

                        <h3 id="mui">Tests on MUI components</h3>
                        <p>
                            As MUI adds layers of styles to its elements, these are sometimes more difficult to select with standard React-testing-library selectors (such as getByRole, getByText).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sometimes <span class="highlight">I've been unable to test certain elements with a data-test-id attribute.</span> 
                            In this case, the solution I found was to add an aria-label attribute.
                        </p>
