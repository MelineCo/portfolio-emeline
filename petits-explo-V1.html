                        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
                        <p>The Little Explorers is a mobile application developed in React Native
                            as part of a final project for the “Web and Mobile Application Developer”
                            bootcamp with La Capsule.

                            This project stems from one of my needs as a mother:
                            finding activities for my child in the surrounding villages.</p>

                        <h3 id="role">My role</h3>
                        <p>I had the opportunity to pitch the idea that caught the interest of two of my
                            classmates.<br>For
                            the design, I enjoyed the process of adapting an existing theme to meet
                            our specific needs. <br>
                            On the development process, I worked on a significant portion of
                            the code:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Redux store initialization</li>
                            <li>Authentication</li>
                            <li>Filter selection screen</li>
                            <li>User preferences management</li>
                            <li>Organizer profile screen & backend routes</li>
                            <li>Screen displaying listed activities (+edit and delete actions) & backend routes</li>
                            <li>Add a photo</li>
                            <li>Most of the design, I did my best to match all the screens to the design.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>I consolidated my knowledge and I also learned a lot along the way! <br>
                            And it was a very rewarding experience to see our combined efforts
                            bring the project to life &#x2728;.</p>

                        <p>To complete this project, we needed the following skills:</p>

                        <p>We started by imagining a storyboard.<br>
                            As we were working remotely, we sketched it out digitally.</p>

                        <h3 id="tests">User tests</h3>
                        <p>Here are the main characteristics of potential users of our application:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Parents of young children or nannies</li>
                            <li>Looking for children activities</li>
                            <li>Living in a medium-sized town or village</li>
                        </ul>


                        <p>After the creation of our storyboard, we carried out user tests with a panel of 5 people
                            meeting
                            our potential user criteria. Those tests provided valuable feedbacks.

                        <p>We then created wireframes based on the storyboards and made a few modifications
                            following user

                        <p>Thanks to the Figma community, we were able to use a model that corresponded well to our
                            project and
                            adapt it to our needs. This enabled us to get a nice design without spending too much
                            time on it,
                            and to devote ourselves fully to development.</p>

                        <p>Before designing a sprint backlog, I took the screens one by one to identify all the
                            tasks to be
                            completed.</p>

                        <h3 id="backlogs">Projects backlog</h3>
                        <p>It was then easier to divide the user stories into sub-tasks and prioritize them in
                            relation to each
                            other.<br>
                            We used Trello to divide up the tasks and track their progress.</p>

                        <h3 id="difficulties">Difficulties</h3>
                        <p>
                            What gave me the most trouble was managing a conflict between displaying the keyboard
                            when selecting
                            an input field and displaying the “Register” button on the account creation page. I
                            finally got it
                            right on iPhone, but not on Android.
                        </p>
                        <p>It was a headache trying to align the way the application worked on an Android phone with
                            that of an
                            Apple phone. Particularly for keyboard positioning and pin selection on the map. We had
                            to choose
                            between the two.
                            As I was in charge of the styling, we chose to do a great job on iPhone because I have
                            one.</p>
                        <p>Also, modifying the style of the material top tabs navigator was not easy. I couldn't
                            figure out how
                            to do it. I read the docs over and over again but what finally helped me was... ChatGPT.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="lessons">Lessons learned</h3>
                        <p>The keys to our project's success were <span class="highlight">communication</span> and
                            <span class="highlight">mutual support</span>. During those two weeks, we'd do an
                            early-morning and an early-afternoon review, and we'd take the time to help each other
                            out when one
                            of us got stuck for too long. I also realized that going through fast crapy code is a
                            great way to
                            understand the <span class="highlight">importance of clean code</span>.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="improvements">What I would do differently</h3>
                        <p>Looking back, now that I've learned more stuff about React or MongoDB, I would:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use $geonear in MongoDB. It outputs documents in order of nearest to farthest from a
                                specified
                                point.</li>
                            <li>Filter activies on the front-end instead of the back-end. This would have simplified
                                our
                                back-end
                                and the user experience would have been more reactive.</li>
                            <li>Add personalized hooks for data fetching, geolocation & autocomplete.</li>
                            <li>Use a form state object instead of several states.</li>
                        </ul>
