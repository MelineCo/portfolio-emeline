                <h3>A mobile app to list or find family activities near you</h3>

                <img class="screenshots" src="assets/iphone_mockup-carre.jpg" alt="project img">

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The Little Explorers is a mobile application developed in React Native
                    as part of a final project for the “Web and Mobile Application Developer”
                    bootcamp with La Capsule.

                    This project stems from one of my needs as a mother:
                    finding activities for my child in the surrounding villages.</p>

                <h3>Core functionalities</h3>
                <ul class="functionalities">
                    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i>Account creation</li>
                    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i>Activity search with filters</li>
                    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-location-dot"></i>Geolocation</li>
                    <li><i class="fas fa-heart"></i>Saving favorite activities</li>
                    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-gears"></i>Setting user preferences in the profile</li>
                    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i>Management of the activities by the associations
                        (creation, modification, deletion)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>My role</h3>
                <p>I had the opportunity to pitch the idea that caught the interest of two of my classmates.<br>For
                    the design, I enjoyed the process of adapting an existing theme to meet
                    our specific needs. <br>
                    On the development process, I worked on a significant portion of
                    the code:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Redux store initialization</li>
                    <li>Authentication</li>
                    <li>Filter selection screen</li>
                    <li>User preferences management</li>
                    <li>Organizer profile screen & backend routes</li>
                    <li>Screen displaying listed activities (+edit and delete actions) & backend routes</li>
                    <li>Add a photo</li>
                    <li>Most of the design, I did my best to match all the screens to the design.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I consolidated my knowledge and I also learned a lot along the way! <br>
                    And it was a very rewarding experience to see our combined efforts
                    bring the project to life &#x2728;.</p>

                <h3>Required skills</h3>
                <p>To complete this project, we needed the following skills:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Teamwork on <span class="highlight">Github</span></li>

                        components.</li>
                    <li>Use libraries: bcrypt, uid2, uniqid, FontAwesome, Cloudinary, moment, mongoose, node-fetch,

                </ul>

                <h2>Design and prototyping</h2>
                <h3>Storyboard</h3>
                <p>We started by imagining a storyboard.<br>
                    As we were working remotely, we sketched it out digitally.</p>
                <img class="screenshots" src="assets/storyboard.png" alt="storyboard">

                <h3>User tests</h3>
                <p>Here are the main characteristics of potential users of our application:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Parents of young children or nannies</li>
                    <li>Looking for children activities</li>
                    <li>Living in a medium-sized town or village</li>
                </ul>


                <p>After the creation of our storyboard, we carried out user tests with a panel of 5 people meeting
                    our potential user criteria. Those tests provided valuable feedbacks.

                <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                <p>We then created wireframes based on the storyboards and made a few modifications following user
                    testing.</p>
                <img class="screenshots" src="assets/wireframes.png" alt="wireframes">

                <h3>Mock up</h3>
                <p>Thanks to the Figma community, we were able to use a model that corresponded well to our project and
                    adapt it to our needs. This enabled us to get a nice design without spending too much time on it,
                    and to devote ourselves fully to development.</p>

                <h2>Project management</h2>

                <h3>Quick mental outline of the project</h3>
                <p>Before designing a sprint backlog, I took the screens one by one to identify all the tasks to be
                    completed.</p>
                <img class="screenshots" src="assets/quick-mental-outline.jpeg" alt="mental-outline">

                <h3>Projects backlog</h3>
                <p>It was then easier to divide the user stories into sub-tasks and prioritize them in relation to each
                    other.<br>
                    We used Trello to divide up the tasks and track their progress.</p>
                <img class="screenshots" src="assets/kanban-board.png" alt="kanban">

                <h2>Development</h2>

                <h3>Difficulties</h3>
                <p>
                    What gave me the most trouble was managing a conflict between displaying the keyboard when selecting
                    an input field and displaying the “Register” button on the account creation page. I finally got it
                    right on iPhone, but not on Android.
                </p>
                <p>It was a headache trying to align the way the application worked on an Android phone with that of an
                    Apple phone. Particularly for keyboard positioning and pin selection on the map. We had to choose
                    between the two.
                    As I was in charge of the styling, we chose to do a great job on iPhone because I have one.</p>
                <p>Also, modifying the style of the material top tabs navigator was not easy. I couldn't figure out how
                    to do it. I read the docs over and over again but what finally helped me was... ChatGPT.</p>

                <h3>Lessons learned</h3>
                <p>The keys to our project's success were <span class="highlight">communication</span> and <span
                        class="highlight">mutual support</span>. During those two weeks, we'd do an
                    early-morning and an early-afternoon review, and we'd take the time to help each other out when one
                    of us got stuck for too long. I also realized that going through fast crapy code is a great way to
                    understand the <span class="highlight">importance of clean code</span>.</p>

                <h3>What I would do differently</h3>
                <p>Looking back, now that I've learned more stuff about React or MongoDB, I would:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use $geonear in MongoDB. It outputs documents in order of nearest to farthest from a specified
                        point.</li>
                    <li>Filter activies on the front-end instead of the back-end. This would have simplified our
                        back-end
                        and the user experience would have been more reactive.</li>
                    <li>Add personalized hooks for data fetching, geolocation & autocomplete.</li>
                    <li>Use a form state object instead of several states.</li>
                </ul>
